    <h3>RHEMA Online Chinese Level 1 Courses For Credit</h3>
    <p>
Courses are divided into four modules, each with three courses. Modules must be completed in order. There is a quiz given for review purposes half-way through each course as well as a graded exam at the end. Be sure to read the appropriate resources with each course, too. Remember, once you have completed a module, you can continue to access and watch those courses as often as you like. Track your progress in your profile area.

Are you completing these courses as a group that wants to do so for credit? You may all watch the videos as a group, but in order for each individual to take the courses for credit, each person will need to register online individually to be able to take exams and track their progress.
